# Deploying Python models for real-time scoring using Azure Machine Learning

In this repository there are a number of tutorials in Jupyter notebooks that have step-by-step instructions on (1) how to train a machine learning model using Python; (2) how to deploy a trained machine learning model throught Azure Machine Learning (AzureML). The tutorials cover how to deploy models on following deployment target:

- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster](./{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/aks)
- [Azure IoT Edge](./{{cookiecutter.project_name}}/iotedge)

## Overview
This scenario shows how to deploy a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) matching model as a web service to provide predictions for user questions. For this scenario, “Input Data” in the [architecture diagram](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/ai/realtime-scoring-python) refers to text strings containing the user questions to match with a list of FAQs. The scenario is designed for the Scikit-Learn machine learning library for Python but can be generalized to any scenario that uses Python models to make real-time predictions.

## Design
<!-- ![alt text](Design.png "Design") -->
The scenario uses a subset of Stack Overflow question data which includes original questions tagged as JavaScript, their duplicate questions, and their answers. It trains a Scikit-Learn pipeline to predict the match probability of a duplicate question with each of the original questions. These predictions are made in real time using a REST API endpoint.
The application flow for this architecture is as follows:
1.	The client sends a HTTP POST request with the encoded question data.
2.	The  webservice extracts the question from the request
3.	The question is then sent to the Scikit-learn pipeline model for featurization and scoring. 
4.	The matching FAQ questions with their scores are then piped into a JSON object and returned to the client.

An example app that consumes the results is included with the scenario.

## Prerequisites
1. Linux (Ubuntu).
2. [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/linux/docker-ee/ubuntu) installed.
4. [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com).

**NOTE**
You will need to be able to run docker commands without sudo to run this tutorial. Use the following commands to do this.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

The tutorial was developed on an [Azure Ubuntu
DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro),
which addresses the first three prerequisites.

## Setup
To set up your environment to run these notebooks, please follow these steps.  They setup the notebooks to use Docker and Azure seamlessly.
1. Create an _Ubuntu_ _Linux_ DSVM and perform the following steps.

2. Install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), a tool creates projects from project templates.
```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

3. Use cookiecutter to clone this repository. Cookiecutter will prompt a series of questions where you will choose a specific framework, select your deployment settings, and obtain an Azure ML workspace.
   ```bash
   cookiecutter https://github.com/Microsoft/MLAKSDeployAML.git
   ```
   You will be asked to choose or enter information such as *project name*, *subsciption id*, *resource group*, etc. in an interactive way. You can press *Enter* to accept the default value or enter a value of your choice. For example, if you want to learn how to deploy machine learing model on AKS Cluster, you should choose the value "aks" for variable *deployment_type*. Instead, if you want to learn about deploying machine learning model on IoT Edge, you should select "iotedge" for the variable *deployment_type*. 

   Provide a valid value for "subscription_id", otherwise a `subscription id is missing` error will be generated **after** all the questions are asked. You will have to perform Step 3 all over again. The full list of questions can be found in [cookiecutter.json](./cookiecutter.json) file. 

   Please make sure all entered information are correct, as these information are used to customize the content of your repo. 

4. On your local machine, you should now have a repo with the *project_name* you specified. Find the README.md file in this repo and proceed with instructions specified in it.
